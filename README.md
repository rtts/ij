Inter-Jection
=============

Inter-Jection, or `ij` for short, provides you with random English
interjections, catchphrases, and general expressions of enthusiasm
whenever you need them. Fancy that!

Most exclamations `ij` produces were hand-picked from
[Category:English interjections on Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_interjections),
amended with many pop culture references.

Usage
-----

Use the `ij` command as follows:

    $ ij
    Alrighty then!
    $ ij
    Geronimo!

Installation
------------

Copy the binary `ij` to a directory in your `PATH`:

    $ sudo cp ij /usr/local/bin/

Contributing
------------

I'd love to add more awesome interjections to `ij`! If you know a good
one, please let me know :)
